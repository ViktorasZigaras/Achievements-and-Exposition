It has search, save and load features:

Search: type text in search field as in "A, B, C" - multiple categories are possible and press Search button;

if there are no matches the grid remains empty.

Save: at any point press save to save the exact query text and all received image links to internal storage
and checkbox list right of the grid.

Load: if there are any saved entries during this run it is possible to cycle between saved states using combo-box.
