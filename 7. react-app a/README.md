1. load test.txt where entries are;
2. click on entry or fill fields yourself and click add customer; if address is even remotely correct there won't be an error, otherwise you won't add a customer;
3. click on entry or fill field (Full name for now) yourself and click remove customer; it should select the first customer with that name and delete [! a certain bug prevents variables comparing well to other variables in string values!]
4. save the list with a save button (no directory browsing yet);
