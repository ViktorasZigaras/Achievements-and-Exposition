This is my personal job hunt portfolio, it consists of several areas which I'll outline here. There are both working programs, code, screenshots and the like. 

Disclaimer: a lot of this code has been written over 10+ year period, some Java, C# and Flash in particular; that code itself is not the best of it's kind but it reflects my journey in coding skills, culminating for now in React examples.

1. Angular section; project structure example that I've worked with before, it depicts how a project can be divided to mostly MVC parts and what those parts could be and what could be in them; App Module file ties various imports together. This is not a complete Angular project because I don't own the code, just something I've worked with.

2. Java section; one is my personal old project that I still sometimes use and another is a similar example I've did for some people; they both use files as inputs, both have Readme instructions, screenshots and working .jar files-executables; both code bases are provided, both are made with NetBeans UI tools. The code is not super fancy but it gets the job done; I'd improve the code in many ways if I did them now.

3. Flash section; my other old personal application born out of love for PC game Morrowind and it's alchemy system, a sort of simulation-analysis tool useful for planning potions; it's a desktop (AIR) application. The code is not very good by my today's standarts, I'd get rid of most spaces, split to many files, etc, but it shows the technology and my way of thinking in those days. I've used Flash-Actionscript for around 5 years as freelancer but all that code is not my personal property. I've heard a few of my works are still being used before Flash is discontinued. There will be a lot of screenshots of my work from that era in screenchot section.

4. React section; it contans 4 projects, 3 of them are exercises, one I've made for a friend; two of the exercises are very minor but I'll include them anyway. They all have some kind of Readme, screenshot and code bases provided.

a) Adress is a simple one showing basic React syntax and use cases, it uses a certain Google Maps library to verify addresses;

b) Pictures is another simple one that fetches and displays picture links, very basic in scope and execution;

c) Stock Rates is the one made for friend's use and then upgraded using Webpack and Redux from program below; it contacts Luminor API and fetches stock rates, gives various means to load, change and save information about purchases a user made over time and what happened to their value; a special note for the "middle man attack" I've used here by using PHP API to get info from Luminor API since their server is not configured for direct browser access generating CORS header blocks; (Separate link: https://github.com/ViktorasZigaras/React-Web)

d) BitCoins is the most recent and difficult React app I've made up to date and the one that taught me a lot about the system; I've researched Webpack config, Redux storage, project structure, Typings in Javascript usage for this; functionality wise it's very basic - it contacts BitCoin API and displays values every 10 seconds; also what I did not try here on purpose is "middleware mechanics" that would result in Redux turning project into purely event based one, I did this on purpose to understand basic Redux better using it strictly for storage purposes.

5. Databases section; during my short stay at database section of Euromonitor I've read two books about SQL and advanced topics, two separate people asked me to answer database related questionnaires and I did just that - those I inculde here; there are also two more exercises: one about fixing C# code and doing some queries as well as making a database schema, another is about using my own local database to extract data, format it and display it using python. Main thing I did during mentioned stay was ETL project that I took over from other person and improved a lot getting quite good at SQL Server SSIS module.

6. extras section; here I add some misc parts, bits and pieces, including:

a) old C# excercises with visual forms and simple tasks;

b) a Python exercise with very little code and very complicated library setup that culminated in picture generation from special database files, the result is provided (data itself is private) and I quite like it - you can scroll it down and zoom quite a bit before pixelation kicks in!

c) an Uipath simple exercise to filter Excel file;

d) a recent version of my own flower data file where I organise things by areas where they physically are, what they are, what are their origins (imports/family bred/etc) and so on, might be interesting for people judging my Excel skills alone.

7. Screenshots section; since I can't provide code and the one I did over the years would definately use a lot of structural improvement, I provide a good amount of Angular and Flash freelance project screenshots; I named "main" ones as largest and most interesting single projects from both eras (I've worked with Flash for 5+ years and Angular for about 2 years); there are also a few personal photos (you can find more of my achievements in my facebook - flower breeding, minecraft and other pc game construction).

Re: Flash main body of screenshots, they are arranged thematically by the project they belonged to and use naming format (group)-(instance). Some of the minor ones were technical experiments that might not have ended up being used in final products.

And finally a few "fun facts"/achievements I've did outside of programming which illustrate my hobbies and way of thinking more:

a) once a former friend gave me a birthday gift of 1000 piece pirate themed puzzle; after I've assembled it, I've made it into a picture in a frame and I still have it on the same place ever since.

b) one winter I've tried to engineer a board game using simple cut, glued and colored paper for cards and components, it was ok-meh-ish but I would try again if I was bored enough.

c) sometimes I stumble upon a game that I want to explore and document fully in my own way; there were two major ones: Fallout 2 and Morrowind - I've explored them fully, made hand drawn maps, item, quest, npc and other lists, colelcted all or almsot all possible items in games.

d) I run an Iris (vilkdalgiai) breeding program, among countless things I've done with them are: total replantings; new lists regarding locations, quantities, origins and more; large collections of photographs that I keep reorganising into ever more useful form (especially naming conventions); in 2019 season I've had first new blossoms after waiting for 3 years since planting those seeds, they were worth it (you can see them in my Facebook).

e) speaking of photographs, I've made over 100K of them with two separate digital cameras over 10 year period and I only now begin to really process them (deleting blurs, dark views, etc), naming, categories and so on are a big factor that I keep experimenting with; ultimate goal is to finally print a number of best, most important ones.

f) for many years I've been working with plasticine (create, destroy, sort, prepare and begin again - because unlike clay you can do that), in last year of school I've had access to clay and made a lot of figurines, houses and other with it (glazed them too), I've made and laquered a wooden sword long time ago (about 1m lenght), basically I can tinker with physical objects when I'm able.

g) I love logistics, flow of things, and therefore games like classic OTTD or recent Transport Fever can get me invested for a long time, specifically in TF I can create an interconnected system where different types of vechicles can form interconnected chains of item deliveries, even I can't predict what the pathfinding system will think of my lines and what will be moved where, when I leave options for <anything> instead of <specific> goods; also train track building is so frustrating but rewarding in TF compared to OTTD.

h) I also love some good city planning: Sim City 3K was my favourite until more recent spiritual succesor in City Skylines (that eats RAM like it's noone's business); in CS main challenge is fighting street traffic in intelligent ways to make it flow in coordinated paths, speeds and quantities no matter what (like a system of interconnected water pipes); not to mention "do whatever" style of city growth which is both looking for efficiency and esthetical look in a city.

i) it would be unfair if I didn't mention my worst disease: Minecraft (heavily modded, multiplayer); I sunk over a thousand hours in various maps, various servers and communities over 5 or so years; sometimes I would finish my plans, but often server closures or resets (or fatal griefs) would rudely interrupt me; what remained constant for a few years now is a certain close british friend with whom we built and manufactured a lot ever since the map I've met him; basically mods usually add new and better tools, magic, technlogical systems as well as decorative means for builders like me.

j) a bit different side of me is that I have some humanitarian in me as well, specifically I translate english subtitles (of anime series and movies) to lithuanian and give them to any subtitle group that wants them, that way I remember languages, see new words and discover pieces of art I would have missed otherwise.

k) an example of "because I can, I should" attitide was when I went to state literature exam during final school exams and did pass it with 30 or so points, especially because few people from my school even bothered, and even more so because I was a much better mathematician (back then) than humanitarian.

I could remember more but that will do; some of photographs you can find uploaded in my Facebook posts but those are more curiosities rather than connected specifically to programming.
